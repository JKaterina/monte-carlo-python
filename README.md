# Monte Carlo Option Pricing

This project provides a Python script to perform Monte Carlo simulations for option pricing. It's especially useful for complex options with various features and payoffs. Additionally, the project includes a Streamlit web app for visualizing the results.

## Features

- Monte Carlo simulation for option pricing.
- Visualize simulated price paths and option payoffs.
- Deployed as a Streamlit web app.

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.7 or higher)
- Required Python packages (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`):
  - numpy
  - matplotlib (for local visualization)
  - plotly (for web app visualization)
  - streamlit

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JKaterina/monte-carlo-python.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd monte-carlo-python
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

#### Option Pricing Script

Run the Monte Carlo option pricing script:

```bash
python monte_carlo_sim.py
```

Follow the prompts to specify option parameters and view the estimated option price. The script can also be customized for your specific use case.

#### Web App

The project includes a Streamlit web app. To run the web app, use the following command:

```bash
streamlit run monte_carlo_app.py
```

This will launch the app locally, and you can access it via your web browser.

### Deployed Web App

The web app is deployed and accessible online at:
